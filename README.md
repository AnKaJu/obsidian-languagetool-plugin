## Obsidian LanguageTool Plugin

This is simple plugin for Obsidian.md (https://obsidian.md).

This uses the API at https://languagetool.org/ but lets your configure other (selfhosted?) urls

# WIP
probably still has many bugs, this is not the final version

## Usage

1. Add a Shortcut to the "Check Text" action.
2. Select lines you want to check (or dont and it will check the whole file)
3. Press your Shortcut
4. Press on an underlined Word to get fix suggestions, hover over the suggestion to get an explanation

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` from the latest release to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-languagetool-plugin/`.
